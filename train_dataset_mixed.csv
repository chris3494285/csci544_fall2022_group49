"23 march 2020 geneva new world health organization who guidance will help countries accelerate efforts to stop people with tuberculosis tb infection becoming sick with tb by giving them preventive treatment.a quarter of the worlds population is estimated to be infected with tb bacteria. these people are neither sick nor contagious. however they are at greater risk of developing tb disease especially those with weakened immunity. offering them tb preventive treatment will not only protect them from becoming sick but also cut down on the risk of transmission in the community. as we mark world tb day 2020 the disease remains the worlds top infectious killer. in 2018 10 million people fell ill with tb worldwide and 1.5 million people lost their lives to this disease. covid-19 is highlighting just how vulnerable people with lung diseases and weakened immune systems can be said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. the world committed to end tb by 2030 improving prevention is key to making this happen. millions of people need to be able to take tb preventive treatment to stop the onset of disease avert suffering and save lives"".dr tedros highlighted the importance to continue efforts to tackle longstanding health problems including tbduring global outbreaks such as covid-19. at the same time programmes already in place to combat tb and other major infectious diseases can be leveraged to make the response to covid-19 more effective and rapid.although some progress has been made towards targets set at the un high level meeting on tb in 2018 tb preventive treatment has been largely neglected. global leaders committed to ensuring access to tb preventive treatment to at least 24 million contacts of people with active tb and 6 million people living with hiv by 2022. to date only a fraction of that target has been reached with countries putting less than 430,000 contacts and 1.8 million people on tb preventive treatment in 2018. tb remains the top cause of death among people with hiv. tb preventive treatment works synergistically with antiretroviral therapy to prevent tb and save lives. reinvigorated efforts by governments health services partners donors and civil society will be needed to increase access to tb preventive treatment to the levels targeted. the new consolidated guidelines recommend a range of innovative approaches to scale up access to tb preventive treatment who recommends a scale up of tb preventive treatment among populations at highest risk including household contacts of tb patients people living with hiv and other people at risk with lowered immunity or living in crowded settings. who recommends an integration of tb preventive treatment services into ongoing case finding efforts for active tb. all household contacts of tb patients and people living with hiv are recommended to be screened for active tb. if active tb is ruled out they should be initiated on tb preventive treatment. who recommends that either a tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay igra be used to test for tb infection. both tests are helpful to find people more likely to benefit from tb preventive treatment but should not become a barrier to scale up access. testing for tb infection is not required before starting tb preventive treatment in people living with hiv and children under 5 years who are contacts of people with active tb.who recommends new shorter options for preventive treatment in addition to the widely used 6 months of daily isoniazid. the shorter options that are now recommended range from a 1 month daily regimen of rifapentine plus isoniazid to 3 months weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid 3 months daily rifampicin plus isoniazid or 4 months of daily rifampicin alone.as people around the globe come together to commemorate world tb day who is calling on governments affected communities civil society organizations health care providers donors partners and the industry to unite forces and step up the tb response notably for tb preventive treatment to ensure no one is left behind said dr tereza kasaeva director of who s global tb programme. the new who guidance shows the way forward for millions to rapidly access new tools and shorter safer options for preventive treatment. the time for action is now. tb preventive treatment is an affordable intervention that can prevent families from sliding into poverty and preserve the health and economy of whole communities. who anticipates that as new and safer drugs come onto the markets and as prices fall it will become a highly cost effective way to save millions of lives. notes for editors work by who and partnerswho works closely with member states including the us government and technical and funding partners such as unitaid to enhance access to shorter tb preventive treatment regimens. unitaid supported projects such as impaact4 tb and cap tb projects enabled by who with partners in brazil cambodia cameroon cte divoire democratic republic of congo ethiopia ghana india indonesia kenya lesotho malawi mozambique south africa uganda united republic of tanzania and zimbabwe are leading the way. the new treatment options are also now more affordable thanks to the significant price drop of rifapentine a key drug facilitated recently by unitaid the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria and global biopharmaceutical company sanofi along with forthcoming arrangements underway with generic manufacturers. more about the guidelinesthe new consolidated who guidelines come with an operational handbook to help guide countries step by step as they take tb preventive treatment to scale. this includes guidance on how to prioritize and invest from demand creation for tb prevention to supervision and monitoring of the programme. the guidelines and operational handbook are also accompanied by an innovative mobile application prevent tb to help health care workers manage tb preventive treatment in their communities. its online dashboard allows programme managers to visualize and monitor data in real time. the application can be customized by countries to suit their specific settings and is currently being adopted in india and philippines. world tb daythe new guidelines and tools are being released ahead of world tb day. world tb day is observed on march 24 each year to raise public awareness and understanding about the worlds deadliest infectious killer tb and its devastating health social and economic impact on people around the world. under the theme its time the spotlight this year is on urgently accelerating the tb response to save lives and end suffering.

seventy five countries submit expressions of interest to covax facility joining up to 90 further countries which could be supported by covax advance market commitment amc)the covax facility and amc within it is designed to guarantee rapid fair and equitable access to covid-19 vaccines for every country in world rich and poor to make rapid progress towards slowing pandemic interest from governments representing more than 60 of worlds population offers tremendous vote of confidence in effort to ensure truly global access to covid-19 vaccines once developedgeneva london 15 july 2020 seventy five countries have submitted expressions of interest to protect their populations and those of other nations through joining covax facility mechanism designed to guarantee rapid fair and equitable access to covid-19 vaccines worldwide. 75 countries which would finance vaccines from their own public finance budgets partner with up to 90 lower income countries that could be supported through voluntary donations to gavis covax advance market commitment amc. together this group of up to 165 countries represents more than 60 of worlds population. among group are representatives from every continent and more than half of worlds g20 economies. covax is only truly global solution to covid-19 pandemic said dr seth berkley ceo of gavi vaccine alliance. for vast majority of countries whether they can afford to pay for their own doses or require assistance it means receiving guaranteed share of doses and avoiding being pushed to back of queue as we saw during h1n1 pandemic decade ago. even for those countries that are able to secure their own agreements with vaccine manufacturers this mechanism represents through its world leading portfolio of vaccine candidates means of reducing risks associated with individual candidates failing to show efficacy or gain licensure. covax facility forms key part of covax pillar covax of access to covid-19 tools act accelerator ground breaking global collaboration to accelerate development production and equitable access to covid-19 tests treatments and vaccines. covax is co led by gavi coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi and who working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers. covax aims to accelerate development and manufacture of covid-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in world. it will achieve this by sharing risks associated with vaccine development investing in manufacturing upfront so vaccines can be deployed at scale as soon as they are proven successful and pooling procurement and purchasing power to achieve sufficient volumes to end acute phase of pandemic by 2021. this early level of interest represents tremendous vote of confidence in covax and our shared goal to protect people around globe through fair allocation of covid-19 vaccine said dr richard hatchett ceo of cepi. covax offers innovative solution to gravest public health crisis in living memory. it will speed up availability of safe and effective vaccines through early investment in manufacturing capacity and maximise chances of success by backing broad and diverse portfolio of vaccine candidates. through covax our aspiration is to be able to vaccinate most vulnerable 20 of population of every country that participates regardless of income level by end of 2021. ensuring fair access is not only matter of equity it is fastest way to end this pandemic goal of covax is by end of 2021 to deliver two billion doses of safe effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or who prequalification. these vaccines will be delivered equally to all participating countries proportional to their populations initially prioritising healthcare workers then expanding to cover 20 of population of participating countries. further doses will then be made available based on country need vulnerability and covid-19 threat. covax facility will also maintain buffer of doses for emergency and humanitarian use including dealing with severe outbreaks before they spiral out of control. covid-19 pandemic like every health crisis also presents us with opportunities said dr soumya swaminathan who chief scientist. vaccine that is affordable and accessible to all will help us address systemic health inequalities. we need all countries to support covax to achieve this goal and bring end to acute phase of pandemic. success of these efforts will ultimately depend on securing enough funding from governments and commitments from vaccine manufacturers to participate at scale large enough to deliver global solution. formal expressions of interest submitted are non binding covax pillar will now begin process of consultation with all 165 countries with countries funding vaccines through their own domestic budgets being required to provide upfront payment and commitment to purchase doses by end of august to secure involvement in covax facility. significant progress has been achieved by covax partners to date with seven of nine candidate vaccines supported by cepi already in clinical trials. memorandum of understanding with astrazeneca also commits them to supply 300 million doses of covid-19 vaccines to covax. in addition in june gavi launched covax advance market commitment amc financing instrument aimed at incentivising vaccine manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of eventual covid-19 vaccines to ensure access for developing countries. amc has already raised close to us$ 600 million against initial target of us$ 2 billion from high income donors as well as private sector. gavi alliance will also work with developing countries to assure readiness of supply and cold chain and training to reach high risk groups. notes to editorsthe countries submitting expressions of interest include argentina armenia brazil canada czech republic estonia finland iceland ireland israel japan

the added pressure on the program due to detection of cvdpv2 and ongoing spread in several provinces see below has continued into 2020. in afghanistan the security situation remains very challenging. inaccessibility and missed children particularly in the southern region have led to a large cohort of susceptible children in this part of afghanistan. the risk of a major upsurge of cases is growing with other parts of the country that have been free of wpv1 for some time now at risk of outbreaks. this would again increase the risk of international spread. the committee noted that based on sequencing of viruses there were recent instances of international spread of viruses from pakistan to afghanistan and also from afghanistan to pakistan. the recent increased frequency of wpv1 international spread between the two countries suggests that rising transmission in pakistan and afghanistan correlates with increasing risk of wpv1 exportation beyond the single epidemiological block formed by the two countries. the committee noted the continued cooperation and coordination between afghanistan and pakistan particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border and welcomed the all age vaccination now being taken at key border points between the two countries. vaccine derived poliovirus vdpv the multiple cirulating vdpv cvdpv outbreaks in four who regions african eastern mediterranean south east asian and western pacific regions are very concerning with two new countries reporting outbreaks since the last meeting malaysia and burkina faso. unlike historical experience cross border spread of cvdpv2 has become quite common with recent spread from angola to dr congo and zambia and from chad and car to cameroon and from ghana to burkina faso. in addition local emergences attributable to mopv2 use have recently occurred in togo chad and ethiopia. the committee noted that the gpei has published a strategy to address cvdpv2 outbreaks but was extremely concerned that the monovalent opv2 stockpile was still depleted. the committee strongly supports the development and proposed emergency use listing of the novel opv2 vaccine which should become available mid-2020 and which it is hoped will result in no or very little seeding of further outbreaks. impact of covid-19 the committee noted the very recent policy guidance of the gpei gpei recommendations for countries during the covid-19 pandemic. this document summarizes the recommendations from the polio oversight board meeting on 24 march 2020 which calls for postponement of both preventive and outbreak response campaigns while ensuring surveillance and nopv2 development and roll out plans continue in full. the covid-19 polio programme continuity plan. the operational guide was developed in collaboration with the regional polio eradication teams and the gpei partners to ensure essential gpei functions continue polio programme personnel and staff are kept safe and to plan for a fast and effective resumption of polio eradication activities including supplementary immunization activities as soon as the public health situation with covid-19 allows. the committee is extremely concerned about the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the risk of heightened transmission of polio and consequently the potential for international spread and significant reversal of polio eradication. conclusion the committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a public health emergency of international concern pheic and recommended the extension of temporary recommendations for a further three months. however noting that some if not many international borders are closed to prevent international spread of covid-19 state parties may not currently be able to enforce the temporary recommendations in all places. the committee strongly urges countries subject to these recommendations to maintain a high state of readiness to implement them as soon as possible ensuring the continued safety of travelers as well as health professionals. the committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy duration of the polio pheic but concludes that the current situation is extraordinary with clear ongoing risk of international spread and ongoing need for coordinated international response. the committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion rising risk of wpv1 international spread the progress made in recent years appears to have reversed with the committees assessment that the risk of international spread is at the highest point since 2014 when the pheic was declared. this risk assessment is based on the following the wpv1 exportation in 2019 from pakistan to iran and to afghanistan and more recently spread from afghanistan to pakistan;ongoing rise in the number of wpv1 cases and positive environmental samples in pakistan and to a lesser extent afghanistan;the quickly increasing cohort of unvaccinated children in afghanistan with the risk of a major outbreak imminent if nothing is done to access these children;the urgent need to overhaul the leadership and strategy of the program in pakistan which although already commenced is likely take some time to lead to more effective control of transmission and ultimately eradication;increasing community and individual resistance to the polio program.rising risk of cvdpv international spread the clearly documented increased spread in recent months of cvdpv2 demonstrate the unusual nature of the current situation as international spread of cvdpv in the past has been very infrequent. the number of new emergences of cvdpv2 in africa raises further concern. the risk of new outbreaks in new countries is considered extremely high even probable. covid-19 this new and unprecedented pandemic is likely to substantially negatively impact the polio eradication program and outbreak control efforts. there is a risk of exportation of both wpv1 and cvdpv to known high risk countries to which it may take a lot of time and effort to adequately respond.falling pv2 immunity global population mucosal immunity to type 2 polioviruses pv2 continues to fall as the cohort of children born after opv2 withdrawal grows exacerbated by poor coverage with ipv particularly in some of the cvdpv infected countries.multiple outbreaks the evolving and unusual epidemiology resulting in rapid emergence and evolution of cvdpv2 strains is extraordinary and not yet fully understood and represents an additional risk that is yet to be quantified.weak routine immunization many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies including covid19 and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio. surveillance gaps the appearance of highly diverged vdpvs in the philippines somalia and indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries. furthermore the missed transmission in china for a year illustrates that even countries with generally good surveillance can miss vdpv transmission. covid-19 is likely to have a negative impact on polio surveillance also.lack of access inaccessibility continues to be a major risk particularly in several countries currently infected with wpv or cvdpv i.e. afghanistan nigeria niger somalia and myanmar which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.population movement the risk is amplified by population movement whether for family social economic or cultural reasons or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. there is a need for international coordination to address these risks. a regional approach and strong crossborder cooperation is required to respond to these risks as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.risk categoriesthe committee provided the director general with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of wpv1 and cvdpvs based on the risk stratification as follows states infected with wpv1 cvdpv1 or cvdpv3 with potential risk of international spread.states infected with cvdpv2 with potential risk of international spread.states no longer infected by wpv1 or cvdpv but which remain vulnerable to re infection by wpv or cvdpv.criteria to assess states as no longer infected by wpv1 or cvdpv poliovirus case 12 months after the onset date of the most recent case plus one month to account for case detection investigation laboratory testing and reporting period or when all reported afp cases with onset within 12 months of last case have been tested for polio and excluded for wpv1 or cvdpv and environmental or other samples collected within 12 months of the last case have also tested negative whichever is the longer.environmental or other isolation of wpv1 or cvdpv no poliovirus case 12 months after collection of the most recent positive environmental or other sample such as from a healthy child plus one month to account for the laboratory testing and reporting periodthese criteria may be varied for the endemic countries where more rigorous assessment is needed in reference to surveillance gaps e.g. borno state nigeria)once a country meets these criteria as no longer infected the country will be considered vulnerable for a further 12 months. after this period the country will no longer be subject to temporary recommendations unless the committee has concerns based on the final report. ,real

seventy three countries have warned that they are at risk of stock outs of antiretroviral arv medicines as result of covid-19 pandemic according to new who survey conducted ahead of international aids societys biannual conference. twenty four countries reported having either critically low stock of arvs or disruptions in supply of these life saving medicines. survey follows modelling exercise convened by who and unaids in may which forecasted that six month disruption in access to arvs could lead to doubling in aids related deaths in sub saharan africa in 2020 alone. in 2019 estimated 8.3 million people were benefiting from arvs in 24 countries now experiencing supply shortages. this represents about one third 33 of all people taking hiv treatment globally. while there is no cure for hiv arvs can control virus and prevent onward sexual transmission to other people.a failure of suppliers to deliver arvs on time and shut down of land and air transport services coupled with limited access to health services within countries as result of pandemic were among causes cited for disruptions in survey.;the findings of this survey are deeply concerning said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. countries and their development partners must do all they can to ensure that people who need hiv treatment continue to access it. we can not let covid-19 pandemic undo hard won gains in global response to this disease. stalled progressaccording to data released today from unaids and who new hiv infections fell by 39 between 2000 and 2019. hiv related deaths fell by 51 over same time period and some 15 million lives were saved through use of antiretroviral therapy. however progresstowards global targets is stalling. over last two years annual number of new hiv infections has plateaued at 1.7 million and there was only modest reduction in hiv related death from 730 000 in 2018 to 690 000 in 2019. despite steady advances in scaling up treatment coverage with more than 25 million people in need of arvs receiving them in 2019 key 2020 global targets will be missed. hiv prevention and testing services are not reaching groups that need them most. improved targeting of proven prevention and testing services will be critical to reinvigorate global response to hiv. who guidance and country actioncovid-19 risks exacerbating situation. who recently developed guidance for countries on how to safely maintain access to essential health services during pandemic including for all people living with or affected by hiv. guidance encourages countries to limit disruptions in access to hiv treatment through multi month dispensing policy whereby medicines are prescribed for longer periods of time up to six months. to date 129 countries have adopted this policy. countries are also mitigating impact of disruptions by working to maintain flights and supply chains engaging communities in delivery of hiv medicines and working with manufacturers to overcome logistics challenges.new opportunities to treat hiv in young childrenat ias conference who will highlight how global progress in reducing hiv related deaths can be accelerated by stepping up support and services for populations disproportionately impacted by epidemic including young children. in 2019 there were estimated 95 000 hiv related deaths and 150 000 new infections among children. only about half 53 of children in need of antiretroviral therapy were receiving it. lack of optimal medicines with suitable pediatric formulations has been longstanding barrier to improving health outcomes for children living with hiv.last month who welcomed decision by u.s. food and drug administration to approve new 5 mg formulation of dolutegravir dtg for infants and children older than 4 weeks and weighing more than 3 kg. this decision will ensure that all children have rapid access to optimal drug that to date has only been available for adults adolescents and older children. who is committed to fast tracking prequalification of dtg as generic drug so that it can be used as soon as possible by countries to save lives. through collaboration of multiple partners we are likely to see generic versions of dolutegravir for children by early 2021 allowing for rapid reduction in cost of this medicine said dr meg doherty director of department of global hiv hepatitis and sti programmes at who.

a new case of ebola virus disease was confirmed today in the city of beni in the democratic republic of the congo drc).while not welcome news this is an event we anticipated. we kept response teams in beni and other high risk areas for precisely this reason said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. as part of the active ebola surveillance system in place to respond to this ongoing outbreak in drc thousands of alerts are still being investigated every day. an alert is a person who has symptoms that could be due to ebola or any death in a high risk area that could have been as result of ebola.as with all confirmed cases efforts are already underway to find everyone who may have been in contact with the person in order to offer them the vaccine and monitor their health status.who has worked side by side with health responders from the drc for over 18 months and our teams are right now supporting the investigation into this latest case said dr matshidiso moeti who regional director for africa. although the ongoing covid-19 pandemic adds challenges we will continue this joint effort until we can declare the end of this ebola outbreak together.the news of the confirmed case came minutes after the conclusion of a meeting of the international health regulations emergency committee on ebola in drc. the emergency committee will reconvene next week in order to re evaluate their recommendations in light of this new information.prior to this the last person who was confirmed to have ebola in drc tested negative twice and was discharged from a treatment centre on 3 march 2020.as of 10 april 2020 3456 confirmed and probable cases and 2276deathshave occurred as a result of the outbreak. ,real

all over the world the covid-19 pandemic is causing significant loss of life disrupting livelihoods and threatening the recent advances in health and progress towards global development goals highlighted in the 2020 world health statistics published by the world health organization who today.the good news is that people around the world are living longer and healthier lives. the bad news is the rate of progress is too slow to meet the sustainable development goals and will be further thrown off track by covid-19 said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director-general.the pandemic highlights the urgent need for all countries to invest in strong health systems and primary health care as the best defense against outbreaks like covid-19 and against the many other health threats that people around the world face every day. health systems and health security are two sides of the same coin.whos world health statistics an annual check up on the worlds health reports progress against a series of key health and health service indicators revealing some important lessons in terms of progress made towards the sustainable development goals and gaps to fill.life expectancy and healthy life expectancy have increased but unequally.the biggest gains were reported in low income countries which saw life expectancy rise 21 or 11 years between 2000 and 2016 compared with an increase of 4 or 3 years in higher income countries).one driver of progress in lower income countries was improved access to services to prevent and treat hiv malaria and tuberculosis as well as anumber of neglected tropical diseases such as guinea worm. another was better maternal and child healthcare which led to a halving of child mortality between 2000 and 2018.but in a number of areas progress has been stalling. immunization coverage has barely increased in recent years and there are fears that malaria gains may be reversed. and there is an overall shortage of services within and outside the health system to prevent and treat noncommunicable diseases ncds such as cancer diabetes heart and lung disease and stroke. in 2016 71 per cent of all deaths worldwide were attributable to ncds with the majority of the 15 million premature deaths 85 occurring in low and middle income countries.this uneven progress broadly mirrors inequalities in access to quality health services. only between one third and one half the worlds population was able to obtain essential health services in 2017. service coverage in low- and middle income countries remains well below coverage in wealthier ones as do health workforce densities. in more than 40 of all countries there are fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10 000 people. over 55 of countries have fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10 000 people.the inability to pay for healthcare is another major challenge for many. on current trends who estimates that this year 2020 approximately 1 billion people almost 13 per cent of the global population will be spending at least 10 of their household budgets on health care. the majority of these people live in lower middle income countries.the covid-19 pandemic highlights the need to protect people from health emergencies as well as to promote universal health coverage and healthier populations to keep people from needing health services through multisecotral interventions like improving basic hygiene and sanitation said dr samira asma assistant director general at who.in 2017 more than half 55 of the global population was estimated to lack access to safely managed sanitation services and more than one quarter 29 lacked safely managed drinking water. in the same year two in five households globally 40 lacked basic handwashing facilities with soap and water in their home.the world health statistics also highlight the need for stronger data and health information systems. uneven capacities to collect and use accurate timely and comparable health statistics undermining countries ability to understand population health trends develop appropriate policies allocate resources and prioritize interventions.for almost a fifth of countries over half of the key indicators have no recent primary or direct underlying data another major challenge in enabling countries to prepare for prevent and respond to health emergencies such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. who is therefore supporting countries in strengthening surveillance and data and health information systems so they can measure their status and manage improvements.the message from this report is clear as the world battles the most serious pandemic in 100 years just a decade away from the sdg deadline we must act together to strengthen primary health care and focus on the most vulnerable among us in order to eliminate the gross inequalities that dictate who lives a long healthy life and who does nt added asma. we will only succeed in doing this by helping countries to improve their data and health information systems.note for editorsthe world health statistics have been compiled primarily from publications and databases produced and maintained by who or by united nations un groups of which who is a member such as the un interagency group for child mortality estimation. in addition some statistics have been derived from data produced and maintained by other international organizations such as the un department of economic and social affairs and its population division. the global health observatory database contains additional details about the health related sdg indicators as well as interactive visualizations. ,real

covid 19 is disrupting life saving immunization services around the world putting millions of children in rich and poor countries alike at risk of diseases like diphtheria measles and polio. this stark warning comes from the world health organization unicef and gavi the vaccine alliance ahead of the global vaccine summit on 4 june at which world leaders will come together to help maintain immunization programmes and mitigate the impact of the pandemic in lower income countries. according to data collected by the world health organization unicef gavi and the sabin vaccine institute provision of routine immunization services is substantially hindered in at least 68 countries and is likely to affect approximately 80 million children under the age of 1 living in these countries. routine immunization of children disrupted since march 2020 routine childhood immunization services have been disrupted on a global scale that may be unprecedented since the inception of expanded programs on immunization epi in the 1970s. more than half 53 of the 129 countries where data were available reported moderate to severe disruptions or a total suspension of vaccination services during march april 2020.immunization is one of the most powerful and fundamental disease prevention tools in the history of public health said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. disruption to immunization programmes from the covid-19 pandemic threatens to unwind decades of progress against vaccine preventable diseases like measles.at the 4 june global vaccine summit in london donors will pledge their support to gavi the vaccine alliance to sustain and accelerate this lifesaving work in some of the most vulnerable countries. from the bottom of my heart i urge donors to fully fund the alliance. these countries these children especially need vaccines and they need gavi.the reasons for disrupted services vary. some parents are reluctant to leave home because of restrictions on movement lack of information or because they fear infection with the covid-19 virus. and many health workers are unavailable because of restrictions on travel or redeployment to covid response duties as well as a lack of protective equipment.more children in more countries are now protected against more vaccine preventable diseases than at any point in history said dr. seth berkley gavi ceo. due to covid-19 this immense progress is now under threat risking the resurgence of diseases like measles and polio. not only will maintaining immunization programmes prevent more outbreaks it will also ensure we have the infrastructure we need to roll out an eventual covid-19 vaccine on a global scale.transport delays of vaccines are exacerbating the situation. unicef has reported a substantial delay in planned vaccine deliveries due to the lockdown measures and the ensuing decline in commercial flights and limited availability of charters. to help mitigate this unicef is appealing to governments the private sector the airline industry and others to free up freight space at an affordable cost for these life saving vaccines. gavi recently signed an agreement with unicef to provide advance funding to cover increased freight costs for delivery of vaccines in light of the reduced number of commercial flights available for transport.we can not let our fight against one disease come at the expense of long term progress in our fight against other diseases said henrietta fore unicef executive director. we have effective vaccines against measles polio and cholera. while circumstances may require us to temporarily pause some immunization efforts these immunizations must restart as soon as possible or we risk exchanging one deadly outbreak for another.next week who will issue new advice to countries on maintaining essential services during the pandemic including recommendations on how to provide immunizations safely.mass immunization campaigns temporarily disruptedmany countries have temporarily and justifiably suspended preventive mass vaccination campaigns against diseases like cholera measles meningitis polio tetanus typhoid and yellow fever due to risk of transmission and the need to maintain physical distancing during the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic. measles and polio vaccination campaigns in particular have been badly hit with measles campaigns suspended in 27 countries and polio campaigns put on hold in 38 countries. at least 24 million people in 21 gavi supported lower income countries are at risk of missing out on vaccines against polio measles typhoid yellow fever cholera rotavirus hpv meningitis a and rubella due to postponed campaigns and introductions of new vaccines. in late march concerned that mass gatherings for vaccination campaigns would enflame transmission of covid-19 who recommended countries to temporarily suspend preventive campaigns while assessments of risk and effective measures for reducing covid virus transmission were established.who has since monitored the situation and has now issued advice to help countries determine how and when to resume mass vaccination campaigns. the guidance notes that countries will need to make specific risk assessments based on the local dynamics of covid-19 transmission the health system capacities and the public health benefit of conducting preventive and outbreak response vaccination campaigns. based on this guidance and following growing concerns about increasing transmission of polio the global polio eradication initiative gpei is advising countries to start planning for the safe resumption of polio vaccination campaigns especially in polio high risk countries.despite the challenges several countries are making special efforts to continue immunization. uganda is ensuring that immunization services continue along with other essential health services even funding transportation to ensure outreach activities. and in lao pdr despite a national lockdown imposed in march routine immunization in fixed sites continued with physical distancing measures in place. notes to editorsdownload photos and broll from unicef and who.

geneva new york 15 july 2020 world health organization and unicef warned today of alarming decline in number of children receiving life saving vaccines around world. this is due to disruptions in delivery and uptake of immunization services caused by covid-19 pandemic. according to new data by who and unicef these disruptions threaten to reverse hard won progress to reach more children and adolescents with wider range of vaccines which has already been hampered by decade of stalling coverage. latest data on vaccine coverage estimates from who and unicef for 2019 shows that improvements such as expansion of hpv vaccine to 106 countries and greater protection for children against more diseases are in danger of lapsing. for example preliminary data for first four months of 2020 points to substantial drop in number of children completing three doses of vaccine against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis dtp3. this is first time in 28 years that world could see reduction in dtp3 coverage marker for immunization coverage within and across countries. vaccines are one of most powerful tools in history of public health and more children are now being immunized than ever before said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general. but pandemic has put those gains at risk. avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunizations could be far greater than covid-19 itself. but it does nt have to be that way. vaccines can be delivered safely even during pandemic and we are calling on countries to ensure these essential life saving programmes continue. covid-19 disruptions due to covid-19 pandemic at least 30 measles vaccination campaigns were or are at risk of being cancelled which could result in further outbreaks in 2020 and beyond. according to new unicef who and gavi pulse survey conducted in collaboration with us centers for disease control sabin vaccine institute and johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health three quarters of 82 countries that responded reported covid-19 related disruptions in their immunization programmes as of may 2020. reasons for disrupted services vary. even when services are offered people are either unable to access them because of reluctance to leave home transport interruptions economic hardships restrictions on movement or fear of being exposed to people with covid-19. many health workers are also unavailable because of restrictions on travel or redeployment to covid response duties as well as lack of protective equipment. covid-19 has made previously routine vaccination daunting challenge said unicef executive director henrietta fore. we must prevent further deterioration in vaccine coverage and urgently resume vaccination programs before childrens lives are threatened by other diseases. we can not trade one health crisis for another. stagnating global coverage rate progress on immunization coverage was stalling before covid-19 hit at 85 per cent for dtp3 and measles vaccines. likelihood that child born today will be fully vaccinated with all globally recommended vaccines by time she reaches age of 5 is less than 20 per cent. in 2019 nearly 14 million children missed out on life saving vaccines such as measles and dtp3. most of these children live in africa and are likely to lack access to other health services. two thirds of them are concentrated in 10 middle- and low income countries angola brazil democratic republic of congo ethiopia india indonesia mexico nigeria pakistan and philippines. children in middle income countries account for increasing share of burden. progress and challenges by country and region there has been some progress. regional coverage for third dose of dtp in south asia has increased by 12 percentage points over last 10 years notably across india nepal and pakistan. however that hard won progress could be undone by covid-19 related disruptions. countries that had recorded significant progress such as ethiopia and pakistan are now also at risk of backsliding if immunization services are not restored as soon as feasible. situation is especially concerning for latin america and caribbean where historically high coverage has slipped over last decade. in brazil bolivia haiti and venezuela immunization coverage plummeted by at least 14 percentage points since 2010. these countries are now also confronting moderate to severe covid19-related disruptions. as global health community attempts to recover lost ground due to covid-19 related disruptions unicef and who are supporting countries in their efforts to reimagine immunization and build back better by restoring services so countries can safely deliver routine immunization services during covid-19 pandemic by adhering to hygiene and physical distancing recommendations and providing protective equipment to health workers helping health workers communicate actively with caregivers to explain how services have been reconfigured to ensure safety;rectifying coverage and immunity gaps expanding routine services to reach missed communities where some of most vulnerable children live. notes to editorsdownload photos report data files and b

who and unicef estimation process revises entire historical series of immunization data with latest available information. 2019 revision covers 39 years of coverage estimates from 1980 to 2019. dtp3 coverage is used as indicator to assess proportion of children vaccinated and is calculated for children under one year of age. estimated number of vaccinated children are calculated using population data provided by 2019 world population prospects wpp from un. fact sheet.immunization pulse survey june 2020the new unicef who and gavi pulse survey was conducted in collaboration with us centers for disease control sabin vaccine institute and johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health in june 2020. respondents from 82 countries including 14 with lower than 80 per cent vaccination coverage rates in 2019 reported on disruptions in immunization services due to covid-19 as of may 2020. online immunization pulse survey received responses from 260 immunization experts including representatives of ministries of health academia and global health organizations across 82 countries. previous pulse poll conducted in april received 801 responses from 107 countries showed that disruption to routine immunization programs were already widespread and affected all regions. 64 per cent of countries represented in that poll indicated that routine immunizations had been disrupted

in the face of the covid-19 crisis we are all vulnerable. the virushas shown that it does not discriminate butmany refugees those forciblydisplaced thestatelessandmigrantsare at heightened risk. three quarters of the worlds refugees and many migrants are hosted in developing regions where health systems are already overwhelmed and under capacitated. many live in overcrowded camps settlements makeshift shelters orreception centers where theylackadequate access to health services clean water and sanitation. the situation for refugees and migrants held in formal and informal places of detention in cramped and unsanitary conditions is particularly worrying.considering the lethal consequences a covid-19 outbreak would have they should be releasedwithout delay. migrant children and their families and those detained without a sufficient legal basis should be immediately released. this disease can be controlled only if there is an inclusive approachwhich protects every individuals rights to life and health. migrants and refugees are disproportionately vulnerable to exclusion stigma and discrimination particulary when undocumented. to avert a catastrophe governments must do all they can to protect the rights and the health ofeveryone.protectingthe rights and the health of all people will in fact help control the spread of the virus. it is vital that everyone including all migrants and refugees are ensured equal access to health services and are effectively included in national responses to covid-19 including prevention testing and treatment. inclusion will help not only to protect the rights of refugees and migrants but will also serve to protect public health and stem the global spread of covid-19. while many nationsprotect and host refugee and migrant populations they are often not equipped to respondto crises such as covid-19. to ensure refugees and migrants have adequate access to national health services states may need additional financial support. this is where the worlds financial institutions can play a leading role in making funds available. while countries are closing their borders and limiting cross border movements there are ways to manage border restrictions in a manner which respects international human rights and refugee protection standards including the principle of non refoulement through quarantine and health checks. more than ever as covid-19 poses a global threat to our collective humanity our primary focus should be on the preservation of life regardless of status. this crisis demands a coherent effective international approach that leaves no one behind. at this crucial moment we all need to rally around a common objective fighting this deadly virus. manyrefugees displaced stateless peopleand migrants have skills and resources that can also be part of the solution. we can not allow fearorintoleranceto undermine rightsor compromise the effectiveness of responses to the global pandemic.we are all in this together.we can only defeat this virus when each and every one of us is protected. ,real

"on 8 may 1980 the 33rd world health assembly officially declared the world and all its peoples have won freedom from smallpox.the declaration marked the end of a disease that had plagued humanity for at least 3 000 years killing 300 million people in the 20thcentury alone.it was ended thanks to a 10-year global effort spearheaded by the world health organization that involved thousands of health workers around the world to administer half a billion vaccinations to stamp out smallpox.the us$ 300 m price tag to eradicate smallpox saves the world well over us$ 1 billion every year since 1980.speaking at a virtual event hosted at who hq involving key players in the eradication effort who director general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said as the world confronts the covid-19 pandemic humanitys victory over smallpox is a reminder of what is possible when nations come together to fight a common health threat.the world got rid of smallpox thanks to an incredible demonstration of global solidarity and because it had a safe and effective vaccine. solidarity plus science equalled solution!dr tedros highlighted that smallpox eradication also offers hope for efforts to eliminate other infectious diseases including polio which is now endemic in just two countries. to date 187 countries territories and areas have been certified free of guinea worm disease with seven more to go. and the fight against malaria has so far resulted in 38 countries and territories certified as malaria free. in the case of tuberculosis tb 57 countries and territories with low tb incidence areon track to reach tb elimination.at the event dr tedros unveiled a commemorative postal stamp to recognize the global solidarity that drove the initiative and honour the efforts of health workers who ensured its success.the stamp developed by the united nations postal administration unpa in collaboration with who signifies what national unity and global solidary can achieve. numerous countries such as guinea india nigeria philippines togo and others issued smallpox stamps to show support for and raise awareness about who s intensified smallpox eradication programme launched in 1967.who regional director for africa dr matshidiso moetis earliest memories of smallpox is of her father. i was visiting who headquarters and i saw a photo of my dad standing with the other experts on the global commission. i remember him going out doing follow up visits with patients. he often would go with a driver and disappear into the bush for days. i felt in awe of his tireless work. the strategies used to eradicate smallpox still apply today.lessons learned from smallpox are used today to respond to disease outbreaks. for example house to house active case finding underpins the polio eradication programme and ring vaccination of contacts is helping to combat the spread of the ebola virus disease. similarly surveillance case finding testing contact tracing quarantine and communication campaigns to dispel misinformation are central to controlling covid-19 explained david heymann professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the london school of hygiene tropical medicine lshtm and distinguished fellow global health securityat chatham house london.following smallpox eradication who and unicef launched the expanded programme on immunization under which 85 of the worlds children are vaccinated and protected from debilitating diseases.with the potential of a covid-19 vaccine ahead ensuring sufficient supplies and reaching people in hard to reach places is a high priority. addressing vaccine hesitancy poses a significant challenge to stop the virus. access to accurate public health information and education is critical to ensure that the public has the facts to keep themselves and others safe.to permanently commemorate the eradication of smallpox and the lessons learned on a global scale rather than every 10-years who is calling museums exhibition companies designers curators and associations to develop an immersive interactive and educational exhibition on smallpox and its relevance for covid-19 and global health security. the exhibition which will be unveiled later this year will promote a better understanding of public health and empower people to keep informed and safe during a pandemic.notes to the mediasmallpox stampthe smallpox stamp is in the denomination of chf 1,70. it was designed by sergio baradat united nations in collaboration with the world health organization and is available for purchase at unstamps.org. the stamp can be

the covid-19 pandemic is highlighting the need to urgently increase investment in services for mental health or risk a massive increase in mental health conditions in the coming months according to a policy brief on covid-19 and mental health issued by the united nations today.the impact of the pandemic on peoples mental health is already extremely concerning said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus director general of the world health organization. social isolation fear of contagion and loss of family members is compounded by the distress caused by loss of income and often employment.depression and anxiety are increasingreports already indicate an increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety in a number of countries. a study in ethiopia in april 2020 reported a 3-fold increase in the prevalence of symptoms of depression compared to estimates from ethiopia before the epidemic.specific population groups are at particular risk of covid related psychological distress. frontline health care workers faced with heavy workloads life or death decisions and risk of infection are particularly affected. during the pandemic in china health care workers have reported high rates of depression 50 anxiety 45 and insomnia 34 and in canada 47 of health care workers have reported a need for psychological support.children and adolescents are also at risk. parents in italy and spain have reported that their children have had difficulties concentrating as well as irritability restlessness and nervousness. stay at home measures have come with a heightened risk of children witnessing or suffering violence and abuse. children with disabilities children in crowded settings and those who live and work on the streets are particularly vulnerable.other groups that are at particular risk are women particularly those who are juggling home schooling working from home and household tasks older persons and people with pre existing mental health conditions. a study carried out with young people with a history of mental health needs living in the uk reports that 32 of them agreed that the pandemic had made their mental health much worse.an increase in alcohol consumption is another area of concern for mental health experts. statistics from canada report that 20 of 15 49 year olds have increased their alcohol consumption during the pandemic.mental health services interruptedthe increase in people in need of mental health or psychosocial support has been compounded by the interruption to physical and mental health services in many countries. in addition to the conversion of mental health facilities into care facilities for people with covid-19 care systems have been affected by mental health staff being infected with the virus and the closing of face to face services. community services such as self help groups for alcohol and drug dependence have in many countries been unable to meet for several months.it is now crystal clear that mental health needs must be treated as a core element of our response to and recovery from the covid-19 pandemic said dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus. this is a collective responsibility of governments and civil society with the support of the whole united nations system. a failure to take peoples emotional well being seriously will lead to long term social and economic costs to society.finding ways to provide servicesin concrete terms it is critical that people living with mental health conditions have continued access to treatment. changes in approaches to provision of mental health care and psychosocial support are showing signs of success in some countries. in madrid when more than 60 of mental health beds were converted to care for people with covid-19 where possible people with severe conditions were moved to private clinics to ensure continuity of care. local policy makers identified emergency psychiatry as an essential service to enable mental health care workers to continue outpatient services over the phone. home visits were organized for the most serious cases. teams from egypt kenya nepal malaysia and new zealand among others have reported creating increased capacity of emergency telephone lines for mental health to reach people in need.support for community actions that strengthen social cohesion and reduce loneliness particularly for the most vulnerable such as older people must continue. such support is required from government local authorities the private sector and members of the general public with initiatives such as provision of food parcels regular phone check ins with people living alone and organization of online activities for intellectual and cognitive stimulation.an opportunity to build back betterthe scaling up and reorganization of mental health services that is now needed on a global scale is an opportunity to build a mental health system that is fit for the future said dvora kestel director of the department of mental health and substance use at who. this means developing and funding national plans that shift care away from institutions to community services ensuring coverage for mental health conditions in health insurance packages and building the human resource capacity to deliver quality mental health and social care in the community. ,real

with sufficient funding it can bring to market 23 high quality rapid tests train 10,000 healthcare professionals across 50 countries and establish testing for 500 million people in low- and middle income countries. its success will be determined by how quickly test trace and isolate strategies can be put in place to minimize disruption of health services and prepare countries for the effective roll out of therapeutics and vaccines once available. the investment case is available here.the therapeutics pillar is led by unitaid and the wellcome trust on behalf of the covid-19 therapeutics accelerator and seeks to accelerate the development and equitable delivery of treatments at all stages of disease ensuring they are accessible to all regardless of geography and level of economic resource. it targets development manufacture procurement and equitable distribution of 245 million courses of treatment for populations in low and middle income countries within 12 months. the investment case is available here.the vaccine pillar combines cepis leadership in vaccine development and investment in manufacturing with gavis track record in revolutionizing access and delivery and who s oversight of regulation policy and allocation. its role is to ensure that vaccines are developed as rapidly as possible manufactured at the right volumes without compromising on safety and delivered to those that need them most. the current estimate to deliver 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 assuming a safe and effective vaccine is developed in the near future is up to us$18.1 billion. in addition 950 million doses will need to be procured by self financing high income countries and upper middle income countries through the covax facility. these numbers will become clearer once we get a better idea of among other factors the technology that the successful vaccine candidates will be based on and the number of doses required to protect people from covid-19. the investment case is available here.the health systems connector is the fourth pillar of the act accelerator and supports the other three by ensuring that health systems and local community networks can fully utilize these and other essential tools in their battle against covid-19. this pillar is led by the world bank and the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria gfatm and supported by the
