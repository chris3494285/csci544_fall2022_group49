on 14 june 2020 who and all countries will celebrate world blood donor day. the need for safe blood is universal. safe blood is critical both for treatments and urgent interventions. it can help patients suffering from life threatening conditions live longer and with a higher quality of life and supports complex medical and surgical procedures. blood is also vital for treating the wounded during emergencies of all kinds natural disasters accidents armed conflicts etc. and has an essential life saving role in maternal and neonatal care.but access to safe blood is still a privilege of the few. most low- and middle income countries struggle to make safe blood available because donations are low and equipment to test blood is scarce. globally 42 of blood is collected in high income countries which are home to only 16 of the worlds population.an adequate supply of safe blood can only be assured through regular donations by voluntary unpaid blood donors. this is why the world health assembly in 2005 designated a special day to thank blood donors and encourage more people to give blood freely. world blood donor day takes place every year on 14 june. as well as thanking blood donors it is a day to raise awareness about the global need for safe blood and how everyone can contribute.the 2020 campaignthe campaign theme for this years world blood donor day is safe blood saves lives with the slogan give blood and make the world a healthier place. the idea is to focus on the contribution an individual giver can make to improve health for others in the community. blood donations are needed all over the world to ensure individuals and communities have access to safe and quality assured blood and blood products in both normal and emergency situations. through the campaign we call on more people all over the world to become life savers by volunteering to donate blood regularly.the day and the theme are also a call to action for governments national health authorities and national blood transfusion services to provide adequate resources and put in place systems and infrastructures to increase the collection of blood from voluntary non remunerated blood donors to provide quality donor care to promote and implement appropriate clinical use of blood and to set up systems for the oversight and surveillance on the whole chain of blood transfusion.the objectives of this years campaign are to celebrate and thank individuals who donate blood and encourage more people to start donating;raise wider awareness of the urgent need to increase the availability of safe blood for use wherever and whenever it is needed to save life;demonstrate the need for universal access to safe blood transfusion and provide advocacy on its role in the provision of effective health care and in achieving universal health coverage;mobilize support at national regional and global levels among governments and development partners to invest in strengthen and sustain national blood programmes.your involvement and support will help to ensure greater impact for world blood donor day 2020 increasing recognition worldwide that giving blood is a life saving act of solidarity and that services providing safe blood and blood products are an essential element of every health care system. participation of interested partners is welcome at all levels to make world blood donor day 2020 a success.international organizations including the world health organization the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies the international federation of blood donor organizations and the international society of blood transfusion among others continue to work in close collaboration to provide guidance and support to their membership in this endeavour.we urge you to join us to make access to safe blood a reality for everyonedue to the current covid-19 pandemic who will run a global virtual campaign this year. we will share more details in the coming weeks. ,real

the covid-19 pandemic is having a devastating impact across the world. efforts to contain the coronavirus are vital to the health of the worlds population but they are also exposing children to increased risk of violence including maltreatment gender based violence and sexual exploitation. as leaders of organisations committed to ending violence against children we come together in solidarity to share our deep concern call for action and pledge our support to protect children from violence and reduce the impact of covid-19 on children in every country and community. a third of the global population is on covid-19 lockdown and school closures have impacted more than 1.5 billion children. movement restrictions loss of income isolation overcrowding and high levels of stress and anxiety are increasing the likelihood that children experience and observe physical psychological and sexual abuse at home particularly those children already living in violent or dysfunctional family situations. and while online communities have become central to maintain many childrens learning support and play it is also increasing their exposure to cyberbullying risky online behavior and sexual exploitation.the situation is aggravated by childrens lack of access to schoolfriends teachers social workers and the safe space and services that schools provide. the most vulnerable children including refugees migrants and children who are internally displaced deprived of liberty living without parental care living on the street and in urban slums with disabilities and living in conflict affected areas are a particular concern. for many growing economic vulnerability will increase the threat of child labour child marriage and child trafficking. we must act now. together we call on governments the international community and leaders in every sector to urgently respond with a united effort to protect children from the heightened risk of violence exploitation and abuse as part of the broader response to covid-19.governments have a central role to play. they must ensure that covid-19 prevention and response plans integrate age appropriate and gender sensitive measures to protect all children from violence neglect and abuse. child protection services and workers must be designated as essential and resourced accordingly. working with and supporting governments our collective response must include maintaining essential health and social welfare services including mental health and psychosocial support providing child protection case management and emergency alternative care arrangements ensuring social protection for the most vulnerable children and households continuing care and protection for children in institutions and communicating with and engaging parents caregivers and children themselves with evidence based information and advice. national helplines school counsellors and other child friendly reporting mechanisms enable children in distress to reach out for help and must be adapted to the challenges of covid-19. given the heightened risks of online harms technology companies and telecoms providers must do everything they can to keep children safe online. this includes providing access to cost free child helplines age appropriate services and safe e education platforms and using their platforms to share child online safety advice. they must also do more to detect and stop harmful activity against children online including grooming and the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse images and videos. as global organisations working to end violence against children we will continue to advocate for and invest in effective child protection solutions. we will collectively develop and share technical resources and guidance for policymakers practitioners parents caregivers and children themselves. and we will support the courageous health child protection and humanitarian professionals working around the clock to keep children safe during these unprecedented times. in recent years the global community has made significant gains in protecting children from violence. we must not allow those gains to be lost during the current turmoil. we must do all we can to keep children safe now. and we must plan ahead together so that once the immediate health crisis is over we can get back on track towards the goal of ending all forms of violence abuse and neglect of children. ,real
